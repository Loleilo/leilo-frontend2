june 3
 - scrapped old ui, was very bad
 - tried to make new one, this time using redux
 - first model:
    - too deeply nested

june 4
 - replaced model with normalized one
 - turns out model for database was already good, just had to copy to redux frontend
 - discovered higher order functions
 
june 5
 - a lot of trouble with polling inside actions
 - finally finished reducer actions
